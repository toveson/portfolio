                <p>Trever Oveson is currently an Inventory Specialist at Clear Home Inc, where he manages and orders
                    equipment for multiple offices. He ensures that equipment is properly consumed nationwide, while
                    coordinating with the senior inventory manager and regional managers to make sure the needs of every
                    office are met. He has been working with Clear Home since 2011 where he started as an installation
                    technician. Shortly after he was promoted to a lead technician managing other technicians in the
                    company. In 2017 he was brought into a corporate role doing quality control on installations. This
                    position evolved into Regional Field Supervisor the following year, where he supported offices
                    across the country while working with regional managers as well as the inventory team to make sure
                    the needs of the company were met. All of this was done while traveling the country. Towards the end
                    of 2019 he accepted a position with the inventory team that allowed him to stay home and
                    occasionally completing DirecTV, Viasat, and Nest installations.
                </p>
                <p>Now that he no longer travels for work he is able to spend much more time with his wife, Tasha and
                    their dog, Hopper. He also gets to spend more time doing the things he enjoys. In the winter you
                    will find him snowboarding every chance he gets. During the 2019 season he completed 105,000
                    vertical feet. In the summer he has started mountain biking, enjoying several types of courses,
                    including jump, downhill, and single tracks. While he did enjoy traveling (he has worked in 47
                    states and been to 48!) and going to local breweries, being home has allowed him to pursue new
                    interests. He is also a music fan and listens to a wide variety of genres. He enjoys a good concert
                    with family and friends. Computers have always been an interest of his and after several years of
                    wanting to continue his education he has enrolled at the University of Utah in their Full Stack Web
                    Development course.
